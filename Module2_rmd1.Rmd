# This is a level 1

## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

here is a link to [GOOGLE] (http://google.com)

this is between `tiks`

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, ECHO=F}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Insert Tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "Top 6 rows of Cars Dataset")
```


## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta0 + \beta_1x $$
